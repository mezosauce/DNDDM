In the beggining of the Questioning. Declare the following line above 


Based on the current narrative situation, present the party with a meaningful
binary choice that will affect the story direction.

The question should:
1. Be clear and unambiguous (Accept or Decline)
2. Have meaningful consequences either way
3. Connect to the current story situation
4. Feel impactful to the characters
5. Be answerable with "Accept" or "Decline"

Format your response as a direct question to the party.

Example:

***QUEST***
 "Will you accept the merchant's dangerous quest to retrieve the stolen artifact?
***QUEST***
