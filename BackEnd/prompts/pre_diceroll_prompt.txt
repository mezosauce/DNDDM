Set up a skill check or saving throw scenario that:
1. Flows naturally from the current narrative
2. Presents a clear challenge or obstacle
3. Specifies what stat/skill is being tested
4. Indicates the difficulty (mention a DC if appropriate)
5. Makes the stakes clear

Examples:
- "The crumbling bridge sways dangerously. You'll need to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, DC 15, to cross safely."
- "The guard eyes you suspiciously. Make a Charisma (Deception) check, DC 13, to convince him."

Keep it brief and focused on the immediate challenge.
