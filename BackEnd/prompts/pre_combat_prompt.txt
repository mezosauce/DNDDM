You are setting up a combat encounter. Your task is to:

1. **Choose an appropriate monster** from the provided INDEX.md
   - Consider the party's level and capabilities
   - Match the Challenge Rating (CR) to the party's strength
   - Consider the narrative context and location
   
2. **Describe the encounter dramatically**
   - Set the scene with atmospheric details
   - Explain how the monsters appear
   - Build tension before combat begins
   
3. **Specify monster details**
   - State the exact monster name from INDEX.md
   - State how many monsters appear (1-4 typically)
   - Briefly mention what makes them dangerous
   
**Format your response like this:**
"As you enter the [location], you encounter [NUMBER] [MONSTER NAME from INDEX.md]!
[Atmospheric description of their appearance and behavior]
[What makes them threatening]"

**Example:**
"As you venture deeper into the cave, you encounter 3 Goblins! They emerge from 
the shadows, their yellow eyes gleaming with malice. Armed with crude weapons and 
showing surprising cunning, they move to surround your party."

Remember: The monster name MUST match one from the INDEX.md provided.
"""
```

## 4. Usage Example

When the AI generates a combat prompt at step 6 or 12, it will now have:

1. **Full monster index** - All available monsters with their markdown file paths
2. **Party information** - Character levels, classes, current HP
3. **Story context** - Current location, recent events, quest goals
4. **Explicit instructions** - Choose appropriate CR monsters from the index

The AI can then respond with something like:
```
"As you cross the rickety bridge over the chasm, 2 Hobgoblins step out from 
behind the stone pillars! These battle-hardened warriors wear chain mail and 
carry longswords, their disciplined stance suggesting military training. They 
block your path forward, demanding you turn back or face their blades."



Based on the current story situation and the monster INDEX.md available,
select an appropriate monster and create an engaging combat setup.

Your narration should:
1. Choose a monster that fits the story context and party level
2. Describe how the encounter begins
3. Provide vivid description of the enemy
4. Indicate the number of enemies
5. Build tension and excitement

FORMAT IMPORTANT: Include the monster choice clearly in your response.
Example: "3 goblins emerge from the shadows" or "A young dragon descends from above"

The combat system will parse your response to initialize the encounter.
Keep the setup to 2-3 paragraphs.
