This story package is concluding. Create a satisfying wrap-up that:

1. Summarizes key events and outcomes from this package
2. Resolves immediate plot threads
3. Provides character moments or reflection
4. Acknowledges player choices and their consequences
5. Sets up anticipation for the next package (if not final)

For the FINAL package (3.5):
- Provide epic, satisfying campaign conclusion
- Tie up major story arcs
- Give characters a proper send-off

For other packages:
- Provide closure while maintaining momentum
- Hint at future challenges
- End on a note that makes players eager for more

Keep it to 3-5 paragraphs. Make it feel complete but not final (unless it's package 3.5).
