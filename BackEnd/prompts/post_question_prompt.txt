The party has made their decision. Based on their choice (Accept or Decline),
narrate the immediate consequences and reactions.

Your narration should:
1. Acknowledge their decision
2. Show NPC reactions if relevant
3. Describe what happens next as a result
4. Maintain story momentum
5. Set up the next phase of the adventure

Keep it to 2-3 paragraphs, focused on the immediate aftermath of their choice.
